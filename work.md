## <a name="webshop"></a>Independent one man webshop (2010 - 2015)
Produced around twenty websites ranging a 2-5K EUR budget covering a variety of clients:

- A casino.
- A publishing company.
- Two food retailers.
- Several scuba diving centers located at the Red Sea.
- Two liveaboard companies.
- A site representing a book.
- A travel blog (sponsored by KTM).

Most of the sites are now outdated or have ceased to exist. The last one I made (2015) as independent webshop was [www.sinaiblues.com](http://www.sinaiblues.com).

Apart from Drupal 6 and 7 web development other activities consisted of guidance on social media presence and management (Facebook) and Amazon Kindle publishing.
