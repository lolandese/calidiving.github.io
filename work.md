## <a name="webshop"></a>Independent one man webshop (2010 - 2015)
Produced around twenty websites ranging a € 2K to 5K  budget covering a variety of clients:

Apart from Drupal 6 and 7 web development other activities consisted of guidance on social media presence and management (Facebook) and Amazon Kindle publishing.

Obviously I am more focussed on architecture and Drupal development now but the above gives an impression of the evolution I went through in my early years. This experience gives me a better understanding of other skills like design and user experience.
